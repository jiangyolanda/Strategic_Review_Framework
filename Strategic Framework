# Strategic Analysis Frameworks in Practice

When analyzing competitive landscapes and market opportunities, it is crucial to combine different strategic frameworks to build a complete picture. The three charts below illustrate how I typically approach market analysis by looking at market segmentation, competitor moves, and financial performance.

1. Strategic Market Focus

The first framework identifies and prioritizes market segments based on size, growth, and structural trends. For example, Segment A shows rapid, policy-driven growth supported by regional infrastructure initiatives, while Segment B is characterized by slow growth due to cloud migration and cost pressures. Segment C, in contrast, is largely flat but increasingly focused on decarbonization. By mapping macro trends and customer dynamics, this framework highlights where companies should enhance their value proposition and where they need to monitor risks.

2. Competitor Expansion Landscape

The second framework benchmarks how competitors are expanding across different market segments. It compares organic growth versus expansion through M&A, providing insights into where rivals are strengthening their presence. This type of analysis helps companies identify potential white spaces, anticipate competitive threats, and make decisions about where to defend or enter. For instance, even if a company has a strong foothold in Segment A, competitors may be rapidly building positions in adjacent areas, signaling a need to adjust strategic focus.

3. Competitor Key Financial Performance

The third framework looks at the financial health and priorities of competitors. By comparing year-on-year sales, margins, and R&D spend, it is possible to see who is prioritizing growth, who is focusing on efficiency, and who is reinvesting heavily into future capabilities. For example, Company A emphasizes B2B business with relatively stable margins, while Company B pursues aggressive expansion, sacrificing some profitability for top-line growth. Such insights help anticipate competitive behavior and assess sustainability of different strategies.

Conclusion

Together, these three perspectives—market focus, competitor expansion, and financial benchmarking—form a practical toolkit for strategic analysis. They allow decision-makers to balance immediate opportunities with long-term positioning, ensuring that business strategies remain both competitive and resilient.
